# Computer Vision Techniques

To be able predicting and classifying the correct input images, i.e. what object in the image, the computer should take
the unique features which in common cannot be seen by human.

These features are the saturation, hue, blurred images, and for more abstract one is the edge of the image.

The input image will directly forwarded into the neural network. In this process, the computer learn how to distinguish one image with another.
